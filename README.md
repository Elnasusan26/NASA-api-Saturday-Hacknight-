## How it Works ?
1. This project displays NASA's Astronomy          
   Picture of the Day (APOD) using their
   public API.

   HTML & CSS: Creates a clean, responsive              
   design with a gradient background, a             
   central , container, and styled fonts. It 
   dynamically displays the date, image,                
   description, and credits.

   JavaScript: Fetches daily data from the NASA 
   APOD API using fetch(). It updates the page 
   with the image, explanation, and a link to       
   the high-resolution version.

   Dynamic Content: Automatically updates every     
   day with the latest APOD.


   Itâ€™s a simple, interactive way to showcase 
   daily space discoveries!
